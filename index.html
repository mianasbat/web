        I completed my PhD in Software Engineering with focus on
        "finding patterns of failure domains across the input domain" from
        University of York, UK. Based on my academic excellence and professional
        experience, I received Departmental Overseas Research Scholarship (DORS)
        from the Department of Computer Science, University of York towards
        my PhD. I have more than 15 years of professional working experience as
        Data administrator, Network Administrator, System Engineer and Web/App
        Developer in various academic institutions.

        After completing my PhD I joined Imperial College London as <u>Research
        Associate in Machine Learning and Data Mining</u> and served for around 2
        years. I am still an honorary member of Imperial College London.
        Later on I served National Health Services and worked as a
        <u>Bioinformatician and Systems Admin</u> at Royal Brompton and
        Harefield hospital for around two years in the Department of Genetics.
        Again, I am still an honorary member of NHS to consult them in various
        technical issues.
        Currently, I am serving University College London as the Senior Research
        Associate DevOps in the department of Physics and Biomedical Engineering.
